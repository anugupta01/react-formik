- React Basics
  - components, events, templates, props & forms

- React Router
  - routes, route parameters, redirects

- Redux
  - stores, actions & reducers.


Components & Templates
1. Components look like HTML templates (actually JSX).
2. They can contain 'state' (data or UI state).
3. They also can contain Javascript for functionality

Ex: class App extends React.Component{
    state = {
    name: 'Anu',
    age: 22
}

render(){
 return{
   <div className="app-content">
   <h1>Hello, ninjas!</h1>
   <p>My name is: { this.state.name} and I am {this.state.age}</p>
   </div>
  }
}

 
Component State

-Javascript Object

-Describes the current state of the component 
 -data, UI-state

-The state of a component can be updated over time
 -a modal could close.
 -the data we output could change.
Ex: 1. Shopping Cart Components
  {
    items:[
      {name: 'navy jumper',price:9.99},
      {name: 'ninja mask' ,price:20.00},
      {name: 'black cloak', price:15.00}
     ]
  }
   
   2. Popup Component
  {
    showPopup: true
  }
 {
  showPopup: false
 }
